| **Tech Stack**  | **Description**                                                                 |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Frontend**    | **Next.js**: Not your average full-stack framework. It's the Beyoncé of React. |
| **Backend**     | **MongoDB**: The database where your data finds eternal peace.                |
| **Server**      | **Express.js**: The minimalist web server that's fast, lightweight, and sassy.|
| **Runtime**     | **Node.js**: Because JavaScript needed to spread its wings on the server side.|
