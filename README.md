as the saying goes:

Moody AI is not your average mood tracker. Input your mood daily, monitor your emotional patterns, and let AI provide personalized insights to enhance your well-being.
```

"we also call it as the TECH STACK."
```

| **Tech Stack**  | **Description**                                                                 |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Frontend**    | **Next.js**: Not your average full-stack framework. It's the Beyoncé of React. |
| **Backend**     | **MongoDB**: The database where your data finds eternal peace.                |
| **Server**      | **Express.js**: The minimalist web server that's fast, lightweight, and sassy.|
| **Runtime**     | **Node.js**: Because JavaScript needed to spread its wings on the server side.|
